# Python-API-Script
This is where I share all of my Python API script

The reason I set time.sleep(0.5), it is because that during previous testing, it seems that the Rate limit of the OpenDota API, no more than 1200/minites, AKA no more than 20/sec. Thus for it to call them properly I set the sleep time to 0.5 seond.
Also, to keep the computer in stable no to crach.

If you want to do the API call directly, please download the 1~5ipynb and remember to change the API key I replaced as xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx into your own to call the data yourself!!!
