# Python-API-Script
This is where I share all of my Python API script

The reason I set time.sleep(0.5), it is because that during previous testing, it seems that the Rate limit of the OpenDota API, no more than 1200/minites.
AKA no more than 20/sec, thus for it to call them properly I set the sleep time to 0.5 seond, for Python to properly call the data.
